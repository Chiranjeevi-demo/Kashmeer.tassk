    <h2 style="color: green;"> Srinagar </h2>
    <p style="color:#fff; background-color: blue;" >Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu & Kashmir (J&K), is split into two by the river Jhelum. The star attraction
        here is the idyllic Dal Lake, having been ranked TripAdvisor’s top travellers’ choice for 2020. You can take a
        shikara ride in the daytime or a midnight cruise for a romantic evening. You will also spot Asia’s most
        extensive Tulip Garden and India’s only floating market here. Hotels in Kashmir cater to all kinds of
        travellers, so you can book your accommodation accordingly.

    <h2 style="color: green;">Sonmarg</h2>
    <p style="color:#fff; background-color: blue;">Literally meaning the ‘meadow of gold’, Sonmarg observes a widespread bloom of yellow crocuses during spring.
        Sonmarg or Sonamarg is a high-altitude tourist attraction in Srinagar’s northeast region. It is home to the
        famous three sisters – a group of rivers (the Lidder, Sind and the Neelum). It is also a popular base point for
        trekking excursions to the Thajiwas Glacier. While its surreal beauty will leave you stunned, a river rafting
        experience on the gushing Indus River will get your heart racing.

        Sonmarg is truly one of Kashmir’s marvellous attractions that you will want to visit more than once.
