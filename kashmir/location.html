    <h1>Location</h1>
    <p>The map shows mountainous Kashmir, a region of the northwestern Indian subcontinent and the northernmost
        geographical
        area of South Asia.

        The region lies within the territory where the Indian tectonic plate meets the Eurasian Plate. The collision
        between
        the two plates created the Tibetan Plateau and the Himalaya Mountains. Some of the highest mountains in the
        world
        dominate the landscape of Kashmir. Several major mountain ranges of the Himalayas run in a west-northwest to
        east-southeast direction through the region; the Karakoram Range in Gilgit-Baltistan, and the Ladakh Range, the
        Zanskar Range, the Great Himalaya Range, and the Pir Panjal Range in India's Jammu and Kashmir state.

        The greater region of Kashmir borders the Pakistani provinces of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (formerly known as
        North-West
        Frontier Province) and Punjab in the west, the Wakhan Corridor of Afghanistan to the north, the disputed area of
        Aksai Chin (formerly part of Ladakh), the Chinese Autonomous regions of Xinjiang and Tibet in the east, and the
        Indian state of Himachal Pradesh to the south.

        The area was home to several semi-independent Muslim, Buddhist, and Sikh kingdoms until the British came along.
        After the Anglo-Sikh wars, the British East India Company stripped the culturally different territories from the
        Sikh Kingdom of Punjab to form a new state and sold it as a whole to Gulab Singh, a local Sikh Maharajah. [1]
        Under
        British suzerainty, the formerly politically semi-independent territories of Jammu, Kashmir, and Ladakh became
        the
        princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, for convenience mostly called just Kashmir. It was a political and
        administrative construct, the "Sentry State" of the British Indian Empire, bordering the three great powers in
        the
        Eastâ€”the British, the Russian and the Chinese.

        The British eventually withdrew from British India in 1947, and the former empire was partitioned into two
        independent countries - India (mostly Hindu) and Pakistan (primarily Muslim). At the time of the British
        withdrawal
        from India, Maharaja Hari Singh, the ruler of Kashmir, preferred to become independent and to remain neutral
        between
        the successor states of India and Pakistan.

        Today the northern part of Kashmir is held by Pakistan. The disputed regions are Gilgit-Baltistan in the north
        and
        Azad Kashmir, the nominally self-governing territory to the west of the Indian-administered state of Jammu and
        Kashmir.
        Jammu and Kashmir is the northernmost part of India; its capitals are Srinagar (in summer) and Jammu (in
        winter).
